## Innovative Idea:

The Gist: 

Have you ever wondered what the hell is going on on Twitter? Well, the Gist will give you a birds-eye-view of the top trending topics of twitter each day. If you have your own personal interests, have no fear. Each user will be able to have an in-depth look on the public's view on your interests. Users will be able to see top tweets, sentiment analysis, and lexicon analysis which will provide an overview of what the hell is going on. 

Note: we are in no way affiliated with Twitter or any other existing application.
